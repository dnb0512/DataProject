# Project Data
An invitation to build a different pumping industry.

------------


## What do we want to solve?
1. Environmental impact caused by poorly monitored systems and waste.

1. High pump cost of ownership, driven by elevated replacements and repair costs.

1. Stagnant progress on technology democratization and environmental initiative resulting from predominant revenue business models. 


------------
## How to solve it?
1. Fast democratization of IoT and IA technologies for all pump users.

1. Data-driven pump commercialization based on customer needs and historical utilization.

1. A complete offer of sustainable user-oriented pump offer. Leverage new technologies for reduced community impact (targeting small local factories).

## How it works?
##### Phase 1 (IOT and AI technology)

We're developing a cloud service that will enable accurate monitoring of status and health conditions on any pump. Using motor current consumption and pump pressure.
Our pursuit with the IA model is to predict the probability of disruption caused by failures throughout time, allowing the users to address needs and avoid emergency repairs proactively.

## What is different?
This project aspires to change the world employing a  focus on sustainability that benefits all stakeholders.

It's true; data solutions are already on the market. Various players have brought them to light a few months ago. Our system challenges the market offering by introducing a customer-centric approach to the solution. Relying on statistics and installation dynamics reduces model training and computational power needed for development and deployment. As a consequence, everyone benefits from the delivery of an accessible and unparalleled product cost.
In summary, our business model envisions an affordable monthly subscription that reaches revenue once a significant amount of users access the technology.

## Can it be done?

As a test run, we built a model to predict the probability of pump events** occurring.

>  Close Valve State Was Selected As The Event For This Particular Case. It Allowed Us To Determine If A Model Can Detect Duty Point Movement Accurately.

##What's Happening Next?
We're looking for a partner who can help us accomplish our goals fast. 

We have been working on our model math; our first iteration is almost ready for testing. We're looking for a partner willing to share its product data to test it for rapid deployment or/and someone who can help us build our company vision.
